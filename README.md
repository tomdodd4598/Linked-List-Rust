Linked Lists Learning Langs - Rust
==================================


Summary
-------

A linked list program, originally based on [an example from Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZEX_l0DFK0), written in Rust.

The program accepts strings of letters and numbers (starting with a letter) or integers and will add them to a sorted linked list. Prefixing an input with a tilde (`~`) will instead attempt to remove one matching entry from the linked list if it exists. Inputting the strings `"l"`, `"i"`, `"a"`, `"r"`, `"f"` or `"b"` will print the items currently in the linked list using a **l**ooping, **i**terative, **a**rray-based, **r**ecursive, **f**old or fold**b**ack method (if possible in the language).


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Linked-Lists-Learning-Langs/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
